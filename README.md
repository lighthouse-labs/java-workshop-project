# Introduction To Java Workshop Project

This is a project that can be used to learn the basics of Java and Maven.

## Running the code

The `SeatingPlanSolverApp` class can be run as a Java program, and must be given the path to planning data and a solver configuration file.

Because there is planning data and a solver config file in the main resources, they can be provided as relative paths. Simply add `problem.yml` and `solver.xml` as arguments when running the program.
